The WebTransport Polyfill is a library that allows you to use the WebTransport API in browsers that do not support it natively by fallback to WebSocket.

## üç± WebTransport

[WebTransport](https://web.dev/webtransport) is a web API that uses the HTTP/3 protocol as a bi-directional transport.
It's intended for two-way communication between a web client and an HTTP/3 server.
It supports sending data both unreliably via its datagram APIs, and reliably via its streams APIs.

WebTransport enables low-latency, high-throughput communication between clients and servers, which is useful for applications such as SaaS with real-time collaboration feature, gaming, live streaming, video conferencing, and more.

> Try it out
> The best way to experiment with WebTransport is to start up a compatible HTTP/3 server. You can then use this page with a basic JavaScript client to try out client/server communications.
>
> Additionally, a community-maintained echo server is available at [webtransport.day](https://webtransport.day).

However, WebTransport is not widely supported by browsers yet:

Frontend developers have to spend time and effort between high performance networking and browser compatibility.
This polyfill project allows developers to use the WebTransport API in browsers that do not support it natively by providing a fallback transport mechanism and implementing the WebTransport protocol on top of it.

## üçú Getting Started

### Installation

You can install the WebTransport polyfill using npm:

```bash
npm install @yomo/webtransport-polyfill
```

for browser:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@yomo/webtransport-polyfill@latest/dist/index.global.js" async></script>
```

### Usage

To use the WebTransport polyfill, you need to import it into your JavaScript code:

```javascript
import { WebTransportPolyfill } from '@yomo/webtransport-polyfill';
```

Create a connection:

```javascript
const conn = new WebTransportPolyfill('https://api.example.com');
```

send data:

```javascript
// Sending data
const encoder = new TextEncoder();
const message = encoder.encode('Hello, world!');
conn.send(message);
```

receive data:

```javascript
// Receiving data
const decoder = new TextDecoder();
const data = await conn.receive();
const message = decoder.decode(data);
console.log(message);
```

more examples can be found here: [test/write.html](./test/write.html)

### Limitations

The WebTransport polyfill is not a full implementation of the WebTransport API, and APIs may change as this project is following [W3C Working Draft](https://www.w3.org/TR/webtransport/)

The polyfill consists of two parts: a client-side JavaScript library that exposes the WebTransport API to your web app, and a server-side backend that handles WebSocket and WebTransport connections simultaneously, the source code can be found here: https://github.com/yomorun/presencejs.

To use this polyfill, you need to install and run the server component on your own machine or cloud service. You will also need to include the client-side library in your web app and create a WebTransport object with your server's URL. The polyfill will automatically detect wether the browser supports WebTransport natively or not, and use the appropriate transport layer accordingly. You can then use the WebTransport object as you would normally do with the native API.

## ü•ë WebTransport vs WebSocket: Comparison

WebTransport and WebSocket are both technologies that enable real-time communication between clients and servers over the web. However, there are some key differences between them.

### Protocol

WebSocket uses a single underlying protocol (WebSocket protocol) for both transport and application layer,
while WebTransport uses a separate transport protocol (QUIC) and application protocols (e.g., HTTP, WebSocket, and HTTP/3).

### Multiplexing

WebTransport allows for multiplexing of multiple streams over a single connection, which enables better resource utilization and lower latency.
WebSocket does not support multiplexing by default, but it can be achieved using various techniques such as sub-protocols.

### Security

WebTransport provides built-in security features such as encrypted transport and origin authentication.
WebSocket does not provide built-in security features, but it can be secured using SSL/TLS.

### Flexibility

WebTransport is designed to be more flexible than WebSocket, as it can support different application protocols, including WebSocket, HTTP/3, and others.
WebSocket is limited to the WebSocket protocol only.

### Performance

WebTransport is designed to be faster and more efficient than WebSocket, especially in high-latency and low-bandwidth environments.
This is due to the use of the QUIC transport protocol, which is optimized for performance in these types of environments.

### Conclusion

WebTransport and WebSocket are two web APIs that offer different trade-offs between performance, flexibility, reliability, and compatibility. WebTransport may be a better choice for applications that require low-latency, event-driven communication .
While WebSocket is a well-established technology that has been widely adopted for real-time communication over the web, WebTransport is a newer technology that offers several advantages in terms of flexibility, security, and performance through multiple streams per connection and unreliable datagrams. However, WebTransport is not yet widely supported by browsers and servers, hopefully this project helped.
