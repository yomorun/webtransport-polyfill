The WebTransport Polyfill is a library that allows you to use the WebTransport
API in browsers that do not support it natively by fallback to WebSocket.

## üç± WebTransport

[WebTransport](https://web.dev/webtransport) is a web API that uses the HTTP/3
protocol as a bi-directional transport. It's intended for two-way communication
between a web client and an HTTP/3 server. It supports sending data both
unreliably via its datagram APIs, and reliably via its streams APIs.

WebTransport enables low-latency, high-throughput communication between clients
and servers, which is useful for applications such as SaaS with real-time
collaboration feature, gaming, live streaming, video conferencing, and more.

> Try it out The best way to experiment with WebTransport is to start up a

> client to try out client/server communications.

> Additionally, a community-maintained echo server is available at
> [webtransport.day](https://webtransport.day).

However, WebTransport is not widely supported by browsers yet:

Frontend developers have to spend time and effort between high performance
networking and browser compatibility. This polyfill project allows developers to
use the WebTransport API in browsers that do not support it natively by
providing a fallback transport mechanism and implementing the WebTransport
protocol on top of it.

## üçú Getting Started

### Installation

You can install the WebTransport polyfill using npm:

```bash
npm install @yomo/webtransport-polyfill
```

for browser:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@yomo/webtransport-polyfill@latest/dist/index.global.js" async></script>
```

### Usage

To use the WebTransport polyfill, you need to import it into your JavaScript
code:

```javascript
import { WebTransportPolyfill } from "@yomo/webtransport-polyfill";
```

Create a connection:

```javascript
const url = `https://wsss.deno.dev/`;
const transport = new WebTransport(url);

// Optionally, set up functions to respond to the connection closing:
transport.closed
  .then(() => {
    console.log(`The HTTP/3 connection to ${url} closed gracefully.`);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(`The HTTP/3 connection to ${url} closed due to `, error);
  });

// Once .ready fulfilled, the connection can be used
await transport.ready;

// Sending datagrams to the server
const writer = transport.datagrams.writable.getWriter();
const data1 = new Uint8Array([65, 66, 67]);
const data2 = new Uint8Array([68, 69, 70, 71]);
writer.write(data1);
setTimeout(() => {
  writer.write(data2);
}, 1e3);

setTimeout(() => {
  // close the connection
  transport.close({
    closeCode: 3000,
    reason: "close connection by setTimeout",
  });
}, 3e3);

// Read datagrams from the server.
const reader = transport.datagrams.readable.getReader();
while (true) {
  const { value, done } = await reader.read();
  if (done) {
    break;
  }
  console.log(value);
}
```

### Test

```bash
pnpm run test
```

### Limitations

The WebTransport polyfill is not a full implementation of the WebTransport API,
and APIs may change as this project is following
[W3C Working Draft](https://www.w3.org/TR/webtransport/)

The polyfill consists of two parts: a client-side JavaScript library that
exposes the WebTransport API to your web app, and a server-side backend that
handles WebSocket and WebTransport connections simultaneously, the source code
can be found here: https://github.com/yomorun/presencejs.

To use this polyfill, you need to install and run the server component on your
own machine or cloud service. You will also need to include the client-side
library in your web app and create a WebTransport object with your server's URL.
The polyfill will automatically detect wether the browser supports WebTransport
natively or not, and use the appropriate transport layer accordingly. You can
then use the WebTransport object as you would normally do with the native API.

## ü•ë WebTransport vs WebSocket: Comparison

WebTransport and WebSocket are both technologies that enable real-time
communication between clients and servers over the web. However, there are some
key differences between them.

### Protocol

WebSocket uses a single underlying protocol (WebSocket protocol) for both
transport and application layer, while WebTransport uses a separate transport
protocol (QUIC) and application protocols (e.g., HTTP, WebSocket, and HTTP/3).

### Multiplexing

WebTransport allows for multiplexing of multiple streams over a single
connection, which enables better resource utilization and lower latency.
WebSocket does not support multiplexing by default, but it can be achieved using
various techniques such as sub-protocols.

### Security

WebTransport provides built-in security features such as encrypted transport and
origin authentication. WebSocket does not provide built-in security features,
but it can be secured using SSL/TLS.

### Flexibility

WebTransport is designed to be more flexible than WebSocket, as it can support
different application protocols, including WebSocket, HTTP/3, and others.
WebSocket is limited to the WebSocket protocol only.

### Performance

WebTransport is designed to be faster and more efficient than WebSocket,
especially in high-latency and low-bandwidth environments. This is due to the
use of the QUIC transport protocol, which is optimized for performance in these
types of environments.

### Conclusion

WebTransport and WebSocket are two web APIs that offer different trade-offs
between performance, flexibility, reliability, and compatibility. WebTransport
may be a better choice for applications that require low-latency, event-driven
communication . While WebSocket is a well-established technology that has been
widely adopted for real-time communication over the web, WebTransport is a newer
technology that offers several advantages in terms of flexibility, security, and
performance through multiple streams per connection and unreliable datagrams.
However, WebTransport is not yet widely supported by browsers and servers,
hopefully this project helped.

### Public WebSocket Test Server

We deploy a public WebSocket server on [Deno](https://deno.com/deploy) for
testing the WebTransport polyfill: `https://wsss.deno.dev`.

source code:

```typescript
import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std@0.180.0/http/server.ts";

var a = 0;

serve((_req) => {
  console.log("> got a _req!");
  const upgrade = _req.headers.get("upgrade") || "";
  if (upgrade.toLowerCase() != "websocket") {
    return new Response("request isn't trying to upgrade to websocket.");
  }
  const { socket, response } = Deno.upgradeWebSocket(_req);
  socket.onopen = () => console.log("socket opened", (new Date()).valueOf());
  socket.onmessage = (e) => {
    console.log(">[" + ++a + "] socket message:", Deno.inspect(e.data));
    socket.send(
      "received length=" + e.data.byteLength + " timestamp:" + new Date(),
    );
  };
  socket.onerror = (e) => console.log("socket errored:", e.message);
  socket.onclose = () => console.log("socket closed");
  return response;
}, { port: 6000 });

console.log("working");
```

### Test on your local dev machine

we set domain `lo.yomo.dev` to `127.0.0.1` for development purpose, frontend
developers can use this domain to test WebTransport polyfill on their local dev.

```bash
$ dig +all @8.8.8.8 lo.yomo.dev
